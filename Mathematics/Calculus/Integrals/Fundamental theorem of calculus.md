# Fundamental theorem of calculus
## Part 1
$$\text{if }f(x)\text{ is continuous on }[a,b],$$
$$\text{then }g(x)=\int_a^xf(t)dt\text{ is also continuous on }[a,b]$$
$$\text{and }g'(x)=\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^xf(t)dt=f(x)$$
## Part 2
$$\text{if }f(x)\text{ is continuous on }[a,b]\text{ and }F(x)\text{ is an anti-derivative of }f(x),$$
$$\text{then }\int_a^bf(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)$$
