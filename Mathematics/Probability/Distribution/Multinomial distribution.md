# Multinomial distribution
$$X\sim M_k (n; p_1, \dots, p_k)$$
- conducting the trial, which has $k$ kinds of results, for $n$ times ([[Independent and identically distributed|iid]]) and $x=$ the number of successes
## Discrete form
[[Probability mass function|PMF]]: 
$$p_X(x)=\frac{n!}{x_1!x_2!\cdots x_k!}\cdot p_1^{x_1}\cdots p_k^{x_k}$$
